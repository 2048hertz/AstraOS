# RobertOS HOME
An ARM64 Linux based operating system for the Robert Computer (Raspberry Pi handheld computer). Based off of Raspberry Pi OS

WORK IN PROGRESS - Currently RobertOS can only be built by the user

RobertOS is easy to build compared to other operating systems.
The asset branch contains bash and python scripts to build the OS.
There is a version up right now but it's not stable and well-tested. It will require some more work.
